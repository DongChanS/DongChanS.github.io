위 포스트는 udacity 의 [Introduce to Operating Systems by Geogia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923) 를 참고하였습니다.

추가로 [이 곳](https://medium.com/pocs/%EB%A6%AC%EB%88%85%EC%8A%A4-%EC%BB%A4%EB%84%90-%EC%9A%B4%EC%98%81%EC%B2%B4%EC%A0%9C-%EA%B0%95%EC%9D%98%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8-1-d36d6c961566) 을 참고하였습니다.

## 1) Thread

### 1-1. Preview

* Process : Can only access one cpu core

* Thread를 이용하면 multiple access cpu with single process가 가능하다!

앞으로 배울 것.

* thread가 무엇?

* thread와 프로세스가 다른점?

* thread를 다루고, 만들기 위한 자료구조

### 1-2. Overview

Thread

- an active entity 

  1. executing a unit of behalf of a processes

- works simultaneously with others

  1. many threads executing ( concurrency )

     => 현대 운영체제 시스템에서는, 여러 쓰레드를 동시에 작동시키는 경우가 많음.

     => coordination이 좀 필요함.

- requires coordination 

  (especially when multiple workers are working at same time and perhaps even contributing same toy order)

  1. some restriction  ex) sharing of I/O devices, cpu call, memory

     어떤 쓰레드가 이걸 이용할 수 있을지를 정해줘야함.

### 1-3. Process vs Thread

#### 1. Process의 구성

1. single thread process is represented by address space

   => virtual to physical mapping, code, file,...

2. execution context -> register, stack point to process counter

#### 2. Thread의 구성

Thread : **Multiple independent execution context**

1. same part of virtual address space

   => share all virtual mapping, code, file...

2. execute different instruction & different access portion of address space & different input

   => Each thread needs stack point, program counter, stack, register...

   => separate data structure to represent per thread information

3. PCB will be more complex structure

   => shared among all threads & also have separate information about every single one of execution context that are part of process

### 1-4. Benefits of Multithreading

the advantages of using thread compared to multiprocessor & multi core system

1. Structure

   Single process and multiple thread in the PCB 

   * share virtual address -> **memory efficient**
   * indivisually has execution context such as process counter, register, stack pointer...

2. Running

   * Input matrix consist of input contexts of each process

     => **parallelzing program** has benefit on speed

   * they conduct exact same code but, not neccessary executing same instruction

   * their still need to have on private copy on stack pointer

3. Specialization

   ex)

   * different thread can manage different customer request
   * Give higher priority to those threads -> to manage more important requests

   * each small portion of thread are running repeatedly -> their information can be stored cache -> **hot cache**

4. another issue

   * not required as many swap from disk compared to a multi-processed alterntve (이부분은 이해를 해야할듯!)

   * **Inter process communication will be easy** 

     because they share virtual addresses. so, we don't need to estabilish transfer buffer or memory mapping

     (communicating data & passing data among the processes or synchronizing among processes needs IPC)

### 1-5. Benefits of Multithreading - Single CPU

Are threads useful on a single CPU? or when (# of threads) > (# of CPUs)?

ex) Single Thread T1 make request move
